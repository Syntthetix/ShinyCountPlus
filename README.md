## Installation
- Must be running Windows 7 or later with .NET 4.8
- Go to the releases page, where the newest version will be at the top
- Download setup.exe, ignore other files
- Run setup.exe to install the program, and it will launch automatically
- Windows Defender/Chrome may give a false positive, likely due to the program lacking a certificate (don't have the money for that) and trying to install to your system.
